# Calculator
This is an online calculator that does basic arithmetic operations. It was built with HTML5, CSS3 and JS ES6. This is the final project of the Fundamentals Course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator).

##Code, fix, break, repeat
This project was quite the challenge. While I could understand the individual parts from the beginning, putting it all together took time and effort. Getting the operations to chain together was especially complex. Nonetheless, I am quite proud of what I have achieved.
